## Features
- **Interactive Drawing Grid**: A 16x16 grid of square divs is generated dynamically using JavaScript.
- **Hover Effect**: The grid squares change color when the mouse passes over them, leaving a trail like a pen.
- **Custom Grid Size**: A button allows users to set a custom grid size (up to 100x100) while maintaining the overall grid dimensions.
- **Responsive Design**: The grid automatically resizes to fit within the container using Flexbox.

## Extra Features
- **Random Color on Hover**: Each square changes to a random color when hovered over.
- **Progressive Darkening**: Squares progressively darken with each hover, reaching full black after ten interactions.

## Usage
1. Open the project in your browser.
2. Hover over the grid squares to draw.
3. Click the "Set Grid Size" button to customize the grid size. Enter a number between 1 and 100.
4. Continue drawing with the new grid.
